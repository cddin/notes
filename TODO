Your task is to create a mini Notes Taking application. 
The application should allow users to create simple notes and save them and load the saved notes. 
Additionally, it should support basic formatting of text like bold, italic, font size, colours, etc. 
The user should be able to create folders for associated notes.
The application should support persistent notes across browser refresh.

Technology Stack
React as the frontend library
Typescript for type safety
State Management Library (e.g., Redux , MobX, Recoil)
Jest and React-Testing Library 
==================================
Area of Focus
React Proficiency – Structure your components efficiently. Use hooks or any modern React features you find appropriate.

Clean Code – Write production-grade code and ensure that you write clean and maintainable code, bearing in mind principle like DRY and KISS

State Management – Choose an appropriate state management library and demonstrate how you would manage state across multiple components.

UI/UX – Showcase your front-end skills and feel free to dazzle us.
Testing – Ensure that the application is well tested.

Bonus – Implement State Synchronization and Conflict Resolution to synchronize state between users and resolve any editing conflicts that might arise.

Additional Notes
Create a Git repository and document your project as you would for any professional endeavour.
It would be ideal to have a deployed version so we can evaluate the application interactively.
